# Pest Identification Android App using Deeep Learning Algorithms(Convolution Neural Network)

This is a pest Identification Android App using Deeep Learning Algorithms(Convolution Neural Network)

Pestify - Pest Identification Android App

Overview:
Pestify is an Android application developed for pest identification using deep learning algorithms. This README provides instructions on how to run the code associated with the Pestify project.

Requirements:

Python (>=3.6)
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
OpenCV
Google Colab (for training)
Android Studio (for running the Android app)
## Running the Code:

Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/VincentOracle/Pest-Identification-Android-App-Using-Deep-Learning-Algorithms
Navigate to the project directory:


cd Pestify
Install the required Python dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the deep learning model (optional):

The code for training the model is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file pest7.ipynb.
Open the notebook using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the model.
Run the Android app:

Open Android Studio.
Import the Pestify project.
Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.
Note:

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and dependencies installed to run the code successfully.
For detailed instructions on training the model and running the Android app, refer to the project documentation.
